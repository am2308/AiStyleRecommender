# AR Try-On Implementation Guide

## Overview

The AR Try-On feature uses Zappar's WebAR technology to allow users to see how clothing items would look on them in real-time through their device camera. This document provides technical details on how the feature works and how to extend it.

## Technical Components

### 1. Face Tracking

We use Zappar's face tracking to detect and track the user's face in real-time. This provides:
- Face position and orientation
- Facial landmarks for accurate placement
- Real-time tracking as the user moves

### 2. 3D Rendering

The AR experience is rendered using:
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- Zappar React Three Fiber for AR capabilities

### 3. Item Placement

Different item categories are placed differently:
- **Tops/Outerwear**: Positioned below the face, scaled proportionally
- **Accessories**:
  - Glasses: Positioned over the eyes
  - Hats: Positioned on top of the head
  - Jewelry: Positioned around the neck area

### 4. Image Processing

When a user captures an image:
1. The canvas is captured as a data URL
2. The image can be saved or shared
3. The image maintains the AR overlay with the clothing item

## Implementation Details

### Face Mesh Component

The `<FaceMesh>` component from Zappar provides:
- A 3D mesh that conforms to the user's face
- Accurate tracking of facial movements
- Anchor points for placing virtual items

### Texture Handling

Wardrobe item images are:
1. Loaded as textures
2. Applied to plane geometries
3. Positioned relative to the face mesh
4. Rendered with appropriate transparency

### Camera Access

The component handles:
- Camera permission requests
- Fallbacks for devices without camera access
- Error states for various camera issues

## Extending the Feature

### Adding New Item Types

To support new item categories:
1. Add a new condition in the rendering logic
2. Define appropriate positioning and scaling
3. Test with various face shapes and lighting conditions

### Improving Realism

To enhance the realism:
1. Add shadow casting for items
2. Implement occlusion (items being partially hidden by the face)
3. Add physics-based animation for items like earrings

### Performance Optimization

For better performance:
1. Use lower-resolution textures for preview
2. Implement progressive loading
3. Optimize render loop for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility

The AR feature works best on:
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for iOS 11+
- Desktop Chrome and Firefox (with webcam)

Some limitations exist on:
- iOS WebView
- Older Android browsers
- Some privacy-focused browsers

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
1. Body tracking for full-body clothing try-on
2. Better occlusion handling
3. Lighting adaptation based on environment
4. Multi-item layering support
