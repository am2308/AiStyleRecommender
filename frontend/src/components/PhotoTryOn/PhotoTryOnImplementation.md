# Photo Try-On Implementation Details

## Overview

The Photo Try-On feature allows users to upload a selfie or take a photo with their camera and see how clothing items would look on them. This document explains the technical implementation and how it works.

## Technical Components

### 1. Face Detection

We use face-api.js for face detection, which provides:
- Face bounding box detection
- Facial landmark detection (68 points)
- Face recognition capabilities

### 2. Image Processing

Once a face is detected, we:
1. Determine the position and size of the face
2. Calculate appropriate placement for clothing items
3. Overlay the wardrobe item on the user's photo
4. Generate a composite image

### 3. User Interface

The UI provides:
- Photo upload via drag-and-drop or file selection
- Webcam capture for taking selfies
- Preview of both original and processed images
- Options to download or share the result

## Implementation Details

### Face-api.js Models

The system requires several pre-trained models:
- `tiny_face_detector_model`: Lightweight face detection
- `face_landmark_68_model`: Facial landmark detection
- `face_recognition_model`: Face recognition (for future features)

These models are loaded from the `/public/models/` directory.

### Image Overlay Process

1. **Face Detection**: Detect face and landmarks in the uploaded image
2. **Placement Calculation**:
   - For tops: Position below the chin
   - For accessories: Position based on item type (glasses on eyes, hats on head)
3. **Canvas Composition**:
   - Draw the original image as background
   - Draw the wardrobe item in the calculated position
   - Scale the item proportionally to the face size
4. **Result Generation**: Convert the canvas to a data URL

### Category-Specific Placement

Different item categories are placed differently:

#### Tops/Outerwear
- Positioned below the face
- Scaled based on face width (typically 3x face width)
- Adjusted for perspective

#### Accessories
- **Glasses**: Aligned with eyes using facial landmarks
- **Hats**: Positioned above the head, angled based on face orientation
- **Jewelry**: Positioned at neck area

### Error Handling

The system handles various error cases:
- No face detected
- Multiple faces detected (uses the most prominent)
- Failed image processing
- Camera access denied

## Extending the Feature

### Adding New Item Types

To support new item categories:
1. Add a new condition in the `processImage` function
2. Define appropriate positioning logic
3. Test with various face shapes and photo angles

### Improving Accuracy

To enhance placement accuracy:
1. Use more facial landmarks for better positioning
2. Implement face angle detection for better perspective
3. Add image segmentation to handle occlusion

### Performance Optimization

For better performance:
1. Resize large images before processing
2. Use Web Workers for face detection
3. Cache detection results for similar images

## Browser Compatibility

The feature works on:
- Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers with camera access
- Devices with WebGL support

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
1. Body detection for full-body clothing try-on
2. Color adjustment to match lighting conditions
3. Multiple item layering
4. AR mode integration for real-time try-on
5. Style transfer for more realistic blending
